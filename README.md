## COVID-19-NASA-Challenge

This is just the backend written in JAVA and using few of the Spring concepts lke JPA,Hibernate,Spring Web and few others. 
All on needs to do is to just clone the project and have `Spring Tool Suite (STS)` or `Eclipse' and 
import the cloned project as 'Existing Maven Project` and jsut run it on the server.

For best results better to install Spring Tool Suite and import project and run it on the server as Spring Boot App.

Hope all of these instructions help.
